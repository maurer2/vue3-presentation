### Composition API
<!-- block-start: grid -->
<!-- block-start: column -->
<!-- classes: grid.sm -->
- Improves Typescript handling
- Improves readability/code organization
- Avoids dealing with JS dynamic execution context
- Simpler way to split code and share functionality
- Allows usage of arrow functions for computed, methods etc.
- More FP and modern React-like
- Improves working with JSX and TSX
- Provides data-encapsulation/information hiding
- Further fragmentation of the Vue ecosystem

### Better reactivity
- Vue3 uses proxy objects for reactivity
- Objects are now fully reactive by default without any change detection issues
- Objects can be made partially reactive
- Requires evergreen browsers (newer than IE11)
- Makes destructuring slightly more complicated

---
### Multiple root nodes in templates
<!-- block-start: grid -->
<!-- block-start: column -->
<!-- classes: grid.sm -->
- Templates can now have multiple root elements
- No more wrapper elements
- Key placement slightly more complex, when using template-tags
- Class-attribute placement needs to be handled manually

### Multiple v-models for two-way data-binding
<!-- block-start: grid -->
<!-- block-start: column -->
<!-- classes: grid.sm -->
- v-model and sync-modifier are used for two way data-binding in Vue2
- sync-modifier has been removed in Vue3
- Two-way data-binding mostly used for form-binding and child to parent communication on custom components
- Syntactic sugar for passing a value prop and emitting an input event by default, but prop name and event can be customized
- Vue3 allows multiple v-models per component

### Event-validation
<!-- block-start: grid -->
<!-- block-start: column -->
<!-- classes: grid.sm -->
- Events emitted from a component can now be validated
- Can also be used to see at a glance which events are emitted
- can be array (for documentation only) or object (for validator functionality)
- eslint shows warning when events that are used are missing in the emits property
