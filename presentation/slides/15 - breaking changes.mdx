## Breaking changes

---
### Filter removal
<!-- block-start: grid -->
<!-- block-start: column -->
<!-- classes: grid.sm -->
- Filter syntax was original taken from AngularJS
- Often used for output formatting like currencies, dates, text manipulation etc.
- Pure functions with no access to component state
- Can be replaced with regular functions or computed properties

### v-if & v-for precedence
<!-- block-start: grid -->
<!-- block-start: column -->
<!-- classes: grid.sm -->
- using both directives at the same time on the same element should be avoided and will result in a linter warning
- Vue2 executes v-for first and creates a temporary object which is then used by v-if to check if the condition is fulfilled. Loop has to be run and condition executed whenever the component rerenders
- Vue3 executes v-if first and doesn't render anything as there is no age variable in scope, which causes a warning
- can be refactored into a computed property that pre-filters and caches the elements
- for conditional rendering (if empty) an additional computed property like hasEntries or wrapping the container with an entries.length check can be used. Alternatively v-if and v-else can be moved into the loop using two template-tags

### v-model naming changes and .sync removal
<!-- block-start: grid -->
<!-- block-start: column -->
<!-- classes: grid.sm -->
- .sync-attribute was used to to allow two way data-binding for props between child and parent components
- has been dropped in Vue3
- can be entirely replaced with the new and extended v-model
- name of v-model props have changed and differs between components with single v-model and multiple v-models
- Option to customize the name of the v-model prop and emitted event via the model object has been removed again
- in components that use a single v-model, the name of the v-model prop changes from `value` to `modelValue` and the emitted event changes from `update` to `update:modelValue`
- v-model name in parent component can be v-model or v-model:modelValue
- in components that use multiple v-models, the name of the v-models attributes on the parent follows the following pattern `v-model:nameOfVariable`. The emitted event follows the same pattern, e.g. `update:nameOfVariable`. V-model prop names are just `nameOfVariable`
